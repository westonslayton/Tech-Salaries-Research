This is a research project completed with three other Duke students enrolled in Introduction to Data Science. The goal of the project was to identify salary trends in the technology sector, specifically among artificial intelligence engineer and data scientist jobs. Statistical methods applied include hypothesis testing, the central limit theroem, logistic regression, and multiple linear regression. Included in the repository is our final written report R code, as well as our presentation.
